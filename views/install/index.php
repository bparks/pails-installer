<h2>Welcome to Pails!</h2>

<p>It seems as if you haven't configured your database yet. This installer will guide you
through the process of setting up your database. This installer is presented for any of the
following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You have the directory structure <code>db/migrations/*</code>, but you haven't
	configured your connection strings</li>
	<li>Your app is having trouble connecting to the database. This is detected either
	in the <code>diagnostics</code> plugin (if you have it installed) or in the
	<code>activerecord</code> plugin.</li>
	<li>You moved your code base and changed the environment defined in <code>.environment</code>
	to one that doesn't have a connection string defined</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel this is in error, check your configuration and ensure your database is still
accessible.</p>
